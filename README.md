**Project overview**

The project explores why many matches stall after 1–2 messages and do not progress to a meet plan. User research included surveys, interviews, and chat-replay walkthroughs to identify friction points around trust, intent, and conversational fatigue.

**Objective**

To design evidence-based product interventions that help users move from initial chat to a concrete meet plan while maintaining safety and improving user satisfaction.
