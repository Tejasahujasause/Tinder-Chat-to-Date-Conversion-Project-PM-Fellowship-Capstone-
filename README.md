problem_and_user_research.docx – Document covering problem statement, research plan, survey summary, and interview insights

**Project overview**

The project explores why many matches stall after 1–2 messages and do not progress to a meet plan. User research included surveys, interviews, and chat-replay walkthroughs to identify friction points around trust, intent, and conversational fatigue.

**Problem Context**
Despite Tinder’s scale and strong matching mechanics:
A majority of matches stall after 1–2 messages
Only a small fraction of matches convert into dates
Users experience ghosting, conversational fatigue, and safety concerns
The transition from chat to meet feels socially risky and poorly supported
The post-match funnel is under-optimized, negatively impacting user satisfaction, retention, and monetization.

**Objective**
Design evidence-based product interventions that:
Help users start and sustain conversations
Build trust and clarify intent
Reduce friction in planning first meetings
Increase match-to-meet conversion while maintaining safety

**Research & Insights**

The case study is grounded in primary and secondary research, including:
Surveys and 1:1 user interviews
Chat-replay walkthroughs
Funnel drop-off analysis
Competitive analysis across Bumble, Hinge, and local players

**Key Insights**

Conversation inertia and boring small talk drive early disengagement
Lack of intent clarity leads to ghosting
Safety and verification are critical blockers, especially for women
Moving from chat to meet feels like a high-risk leap without product support

**User Journey & Funnel Focus**
Right Swipe → Match → Chat Initiation → 3+ Messages → Date
The steepest drop-offs occur during:
Chat initiation
Mid-chat momentum loss
Transition from chat to offline meeting

**Each proposed solution directly targets a specific funnel break**
**Proposed Solutions**
1. AI-Powered Openers and Chat Suggestions
Context-aware, personalized prompts to:
Reduce message inertia
Revive stalled conversations
Improve conversational flow without forcing automation

2. Guided Date Planner
A lightweight, in-chat planner triggered by healthy chat signals to:
Reduce social awkwardness
Align intent
Make proposing a date feel natural and low-risk

3. Trust, Safety, and Pre-Meet Assurance
In-app tools including:
Profile and intent verification
Voice/video calls before meeting
Date and live-location sharing with trusted contacts
Designed to increase confidence and safety during the chat-to-meet transition.

**Metrics & Evaluation**
North Star Metric:
Match-to-Meet Success Rate
(Offline or virtual dates ÷ total matches)

Supporting Metrics
Chat initiation rate
Engagement continuity rate
Date planner activation rate
Nudge-to-meet conversion rate
Safety feature adoption (guardrail)
Metrics are mapped directly to each feature to enable experimentation and iteration.

**Risks & Trade-offs**
Over-automation reducing authenticity
Poor timing of nudges harming user comfort
Low adoption of safety tools due to unclear controls
Each risk is addressed through progressive disclosure, user control, and behavioral triggers rather than rigid flows.

**What This Case Study Demonstrates**
Funnel and conversion thinking at scale
Primary user research and insight synthesis
Behavioral UX and trust-based design
MVP scoping and prioritization
Clear success metrics and guardrails
Marketplace and cultural sensitivity (India focus)
